@article{Mair2011,
abstract = {A total of 21 gauges across the mountainous leeward portion of the island of Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi, were used to compare rainfall interpolation methods and assess rainfall spatial variability over a 34-month monitoring period from 2005 to 2008. Traditional and geo- statistical interpolation methods, including Thiessen polygon, inverse distance weighting (IDW), linear regression, ordinary kriging (OK), and simple kriging with varying local means (SKlm), were used to estimate wet and dry season rainfall. The linear regression and SKlm methods were used to incorporate two types of exhaustive secondary information: (1) elevation extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM), and (2) distance to a regional rainfall maximum. The Thiessen method produced the highest error, whereas OK produced the lowest error in all but one period. TheOKmethod produced more accurate predictions than linear regression of rainfall against elevation when the correlation between rainfall and elevation is moderate (R {\textless} 0:82). The SKlm method produced lower error than linear regression and IDW methods in all periods. Comparison of the OK interpolation map with gridded isohyet data indicate that the areas of greatest rainfall deficit were confined to the mountainous region of west Oʻahu.},

@article{Noori2014,
abstract = {Rainfall is a significant portion of hydrologic data. Rainfall records, however, are often incomplete due to several factors. In this study, the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method integrated with GIS is used to estimate the rainfall distribution in Duhok Governorate. A total of 25 rain fall stations and rainfall data between 2000 and 2010 were used, where 6 rainfall stations were used for cross-validation. In addition, the relationship between interpolation accuracy and two critical parameters of IDW (Power $\alpha$ value, and a radius of influence) was evaluated. Also, the rainfall distribution of Duhok Governorate was classified. As an output of this study and in most cases, the optimal parameters for IDW in interpolating rainfall data must have a radius of influence up to (15 - 60 km). However, the optimal $\alpha$ values varied between 1 and 5. Based on the results of this study, we concluded that the IDW is an appropriate method of spatial interpolation to predict the probable rainfall data in Duhok Governorate using $\alpha$ = 1 and search radius = 105 km for all the 25 rainfall stations.},

@article{Taesombat2009,
abstract = {Accuracy in runoff and flood estimation is important for mitigating water related problems. The accuracy depends on the methods used for areal rainfall approximation. The thin plate spline (TPS) technique was introduced in this study for daily areal rainfall approximation in the Upper Ping river basin and was compared with the areal rainfall estimated from two conventional techniques, the isohyetal and Thiessen polygon techniques. Two data sets of maximum rainfall registered in August 2001 and September 2003 at 68 non-automatic rainfall stations located in the basin and nearby areas were used in the analysis. The TPS technique was carried out in conjunction with two separate sources of digital elevation model (DEM), namely, GLOBE-DEM and SRTM-DEM, which were downloaded from the NOAA and NASA websites and have horizontal resolutions of 1 km and 90 m, respectively. The TPS technique proved to provide more accurate results of rainfall estimation than the other two techniques. The coarser DEM resolution (GLOBE-DEM) performed marginally better in rainfall estimation than the finer DEM resolution (SRTM-DEM).},

@article{Cecinati2018,
abstract = {In urban hydrological models, rainfall is the main input and one of the main sources of uncertainty. To reach sufficient spatial coverage and resolution, the integration of several rainfall data sources, including rain gauges and weather radars, is often necessary. The uncertainty associated with rain gauge measurements is dependent on rainfall intensity and on the characteristics of the devices. Common spatial interpolation methods do not account for rain gauge uncertainty variability. Kriging for Uncertain Data (KUD) allows the handling of the uncertainty of each rain gauge independently, modelling space- and time-variant errors. The applications of KUD to rain gauge interpolation and radar-gauge rainfall merging are studied and compared. First, the methodology is studied with synthetic experiments, to evaluate its performance varying rain gauge density, accuracy and rainfall field characteristics. Subsequently, the method is applied to a case study in the Dommel catchment, the Netherlands, where high-quality automatic gauges are complemented by lower-quality tipping-bucket gauges and radar composites. The case study and the synthetic experiments show that considering measurement uncertainty in rain gauge interpolation usually improves rainfall estimations, given a sufficient rain gauge density. Considering measurement uncertainty in radar-gauge merging consistently improved the estimates in the tested cases, thanks to the additional spatial information of radar rainfall data but should still be used cautiously for convective events and low-density rain gauge networks.},

@article{Karnieli1990,
abstract = {The classical methods for interpolating and spatial averaging of precipitation fields fail to quantify the accuracy of the estimate. On the other hand, kriging is an interpolation method for predicting values of regionalized variables at points (punctual kriging) or average values over an area (block kriging). This paper demonstrates the use of the kriging method for mapping and evaluating precipitation data for the State of Arizona. Using 158 rain gauge stations with 30 years or more of record, the precipitation over the state has been modeled as a realization of a two dimensional random field taking into consideration the spatial variability conditions. Three data sets have been used: (1) the mean annual precipitation over the state; (2) the mean summer rainy season; and (3) the mean winter rainy season. Validation of the empirical semi-variogram for a constant drift case indicated that the exponential model was appropriate for all the data sets. In addition to a global kriging analysis, the data have been examined under an anisotropic assumption which reflects the topographic structure of the state. {\textcopyright} 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {The availability of rainfall data is fundamental for most hydrological analyses and for the design and management of water resources systems .There are many methods of spatial interpolation of rainfall despite their effectiveness and ease of use variables, the choice of one or the other depends on the aim of the study, but also on the territorial context of the area (surface, network density, etc.) .The study area is the coastal city of Annaba located in eastern Algeria, and which contains a low rainfall network density. The purpose of this study is to determine the most adequate rainfall interpolation technique. Three interpolation techniques, determinist and stochastic, have been tested by visual observation and crossvalidation, the best results were achieved by inverse distance weighting to characterize rainfall distribution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
