@article{Koppelman2005,
abstract = {Choice-based samples oversample infrequently chosen alternatives to obtain an effective representation of the behavior of people who select these alternatives. However, the use of choice-based samples requires recognition of the sampling process in formulating the estimation procedure. In general, this procedure can be accomplished by applying weights to the observed choices in the estimation process. Unfortunately, the use of such weighted estimation procedures for choice models does not yield efficient estimators. However, for the special case of the multinomial logit model with a full set of alternative-specific constants, the standard maximum likelihood estimator—which is efficient—can be used with adjustment of the alternative-specific constants. The same maximum likelihood estimator can also be used with adjustment to estimate nested logit models with choice-based samples. The proof of this property is qualitatively described, and examples demonstrate how to apply the adjustment procedure.},

@article{Vijverberg2011,
abstract = {This paper considers the problem of tracking a variable number of objects through a surveillance site monitored by multiple cameras with slightly overlapping field-of-views. To this end, we propose to cluster tracklets generated by a commercially available single-camera video-analysis algorithm which is solely based on the position of objects. A first contribution of this paper is the proposal of a novel, extended energy function representing the confidence that two tracklets correspond to the same object. In contrast to previous work, the proposed motion-consistency error enables the clustering of tracklets from arbitrary views and temporal overlap. A second contribution is to evaluate the performance of several clustering algorithms. The results show that the clustering techniques employing only the merging of tracklets yield 10-15{\%} higher F1 score than clustering techniques using various types of clustering moves including split and swap moves. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},
