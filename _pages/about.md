I'm a `data scientist` who has worked in applications in the fields of transportation/mobility, financial risks and the semantic analysis of text. My interests are probabilistic models, Bayesian inference and data visualization. 

I received my PhD in `transportation` from the [University of Lyon - ENTPE](https://www.entpe.fr/en), where I worked on predicting travelers’ choices in the context of urban trips: an intersection between economics, statistics and transportation. Also, I hold a European master’s degree on `Data Mining and Knowledge Management` by a consortium including the [Sorbonne Université - UPMC (Paris 6)](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), the [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/ca) and the [Université de Lyon 2](https://welcome.univ-lyon2.fr), and a bachelor’s degree in `applied mathematics` by the [Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM)](https://www.itam.mx).

I'm co-founder, editor and writer at [Punto Decimal MX](https://puntodecimal.mx), a blog (open to anyone who wants to participate) that seeks to understand the current problems of Mexico through the quantitative analysis of public information.
