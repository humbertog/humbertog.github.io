    abstract = { The objective of this thesis is to find route choice models that scale-up at network level, i.e., models that predict the choices of travellers over the diversity of situations found in a transport network. The approach is to investigate travellers' behaviour in transportation networks through computer-based experiments at large scale, for which a platform named the Mobility Decision Game (MDG), has been developed. The MDG permits to observe the choices of the participants on a diverse set of scenarios (OD pairs and routes) with varying traffic conditions and travel time information. The experiments focus on the route choices of uni-modal car trips that are based on the map of the city of Lyon, France. To attain the objective of this thesis, firstly a methodology to find OD pairs that are representative of the network is proposed. The representative OD pairs are used in route choice experiments to obtain choice models that generalise to the various OD configurations in the network. Secondly, the choices of participants in the experiments are analysed from the rational and boundedly rational behaviour perspectives, in order to establish the principle that best describe their choices. Finally, the choice models are assessed in terms of their predictive accuracy. This thesis is part of a European ERC project entitled MAGnUM: Multiscale and Multimodal Traffic Modeling Approach for Sustainable Management of Urban Mobility.}
